<h2>What is the scope of possibilities?</h2>

<p>How much control do we have over our own destinies?</p>

<p>We often have little say over much of our lot in life. The circumstances we find ourselves in are not all up to us. However, we do have power within ourselves and our behavior. We cannot live without acting, and the results of our actions transform the very world we live in.</p>

<p>Every concerted effort we make may be backed up with some hopes and dreams. We hope our perspirations are not in vain and that we might be able to achieve our aspirations.</p>

<p>Sometimes it may be unclear what even is possible. At other times we may not even feel comfortable enough to strive for better  outcomes.</p>

<p>Whether we are aware of it our not, our conscious, subconscious, and unconscious decisions shape the material reality we live in.</p>

<p>We were never given an instruction manual or a life map to follow. Examining our trains of thought in a journey of self-discovery can reveal to us our existing tendencies. We may not be able to magically pop ourselves into a desired reality in an instant, but our minds are moldable.</p>

<p>Awareness of possibilities can be learned and trained.</p>
